# Bertelsmann-Arvato-Project-Workspace
The aim of this project was to create a customer segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services, so that the efficiency of the customer acquisition process of a mail-order company can be increased. 

Installations
For the development of the project, the following Python libraries were required: 

Matplotlib
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
In addition, Python 3 was used. 

Summary:
Arvato Financial Solutions provided the data and outline of this project for the second term of the Data Scientists Nanodegree of Udacity. The main objective was to increase the efficiency of the customer acquisition process of a mail-order company.

The project has three major steps: 
1. Customer Segmentation Report
This section is similar to the corresponding project in Term 1 of the program, but the datasets now include more features. The project begins by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.
2. Supervised Learning Model
Within this part, a third dataset is provided with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign, and the previous analysis will be used to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
3. Kaggle Competition
Once the model is chosen, predictions on the campaign data are calculated as part of a Kaggle Competition. 

Data
Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).
